# Generation Identifier Program

This program takes the user's birth year as input and identifies which generation they belong to based on the commonly accepted generational classifications.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your birth year when prompted. **Note:** The program will crash if you enter decimals, special characters, or alphabets.
3. The program will then determine which generation you belong to and display the result.

## Disclaimer

- This program relies on commonly accepted generational classifications, which may vary slightly depending on the source.
- The classification ranges are based on the approximate birth years commonly associated with each generation.
- If the user's input contains decimals, special characters, or alphabets, the program will crash.
- If the user's birth year falls outside of the specified ranges, the program will display "No information."

## Issues

If you encounter any problems with the program, please report them in the [Issues](https://github.com/Arpan646/Generation-Finder/issues/new/choose) section of this repository.
